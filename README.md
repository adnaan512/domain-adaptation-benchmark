## Limitations

This benchmark focuses on CIFAR-10-C using a ResNet-50 backbone.
While it provides controlled evaluation across common corruptions,
results may not directly transfer to larger datasets such as
ImageNet-C or real-world deployment scenarios.
Future work includes evaluating Vision Transformers and larger-scale benchmarks.

## Abstract

Deep learning models deployed in the real world routinely encounter data
distributions that differ from their training data.  Autonomous vehicles
trained in clear conditions can see accuracy drop significantly in rain or
heavy fog ([Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261)).
Medical imaging models may experience substantial performance degradation when evaluated on scanners with different calibration settings. This problem — **distribution shift**  is one of the
most significant barriers to reliable AI deployment.

**Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)** addresses this without requiring labelled data
from the new environment: the model adapts to the test distribution using
only the unlabelled test batch itself.  This benchmark systematically
evaluates four strategies on CIFAR-10-C (15 corruption types × 5 severity
levels) using a ResNet-50 backbone. CIFAR-10-C consists of 15 corruption types × 5 severity levels with 10,000 test images per corruption.

## Counter-Intuitive Finding: Pseudo-Label Fails on Blur

Pseudo-label adaptation **severely degrades accuracy below the no-adaptation baseline**
on all four blur corruption types:

![Pseudo-Label Failure Analysis](figures/pl_failure_analysis.png)

| Corruption | Baseline | Pseudo-Label | Accuracy Drop |
|------------|----------|-------------|---|
| **zoom_blur** | 80.21% | 38.37% | **-41.84%** |
| **motion_blur** | 71.77% | 32.29% | **-39.48%** |
| **glass_blur** | 64.67% | 34.29% | **-30.38%** |
| **defocus_blur** | 89.26% | 84.20% | **-5.06%** |

**Root cause  Confirmation Bias in Self-Training:**

Blur corruptions cause the model to make *confidently wrong* predictions.
A blurred image may lose fine-grained detail while retaining coarse texture that the model has learned to associate with the wrong class.
The model makes an incorrect prediction with high confidence — well above the 0.9 threshold.
This incorrect pseudo-label is used to fine-tune the model, reinforcing the
wrong association.  After fine-tuning, the model performs vastly worse than if it had not adapted at all.

This is the **confirmation bias** failure mode: the model's confident errors
are used to train it toward those same errors.

---

## Entropy Analysis (RQ3)

**Hypothesis:** Can pre-adaptation entropy predict which corruptions benefit most from TTA?

![Entropy Gain Scatter](figures/entropy_gain_scatter.png)

We discovered an **extremely strong positive correlation (Pearson r = +0.9384)** between the pre-adaptation entropy (uncertainty) and the accuracy gain achieved by TENT. 

Corruptions that confuse the model the most initially (like `gaussian_noise` and `impulse_noise`) have the highest entropy and see the most dramatic improvements from TENT (+25% accuracy gain). Corruptions the model is already confident about (like `brightness`) see almost no benefit.



---

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Why reset model between corruptions?
Without reset, BN statistics adapted to `gaussian_noise` contaminate the
evaluation of `fog`. Resetting to the original weights before each corruption ensures every evaluation is independent.

### Decision 2: Why update only BN affine params in TENT?
1. **Stability**: Updating all weights on a small, unlabelled test batch leads to catastrophic forgetting. 
2. **Effectiveness**: BN affine parameters (γ, β) directly control the scale and shift of every feature map. They are the most targeted lever for correcting distribution mismatch.
